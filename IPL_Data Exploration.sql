SELECT Player, Team, Price_in_cr, 
	CAST(Price_in_cr/ (SUM(Price_in_cr) OVER (PARTITION BY Team)) * 100 AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS ContributionPercentage
FROM IPLPlayers


--Q7 Classify players as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' priced based on the following rules:
--High: Price > ₹15 crore
--Medium: Price between ₹5 crore and ₹15 crore
--Low: Price < ₹5 crore

FROM IPLPlayers p
WHERE Price_in_cr = (
						SELECT MAX(Price_in_cr) 
						FROM IPLPlayers
						WHERE Role = p.Role
